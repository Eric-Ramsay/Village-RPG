SERVER FUNCTIONS
	Connect() - Connects to the Server

	Listen()
	- Listens for incoming messages. Messages may not be received all at once, so it stores them in a buffer. Messages from the server end with 'stop!', once that's received, the message is completed and added to a linked list to be processed in processMessages()
	- Supporting Functions: 
		- endsWith() - used to see if the incoming messages end with 'stop!'
		- nextMessage() - loops through the messageBuffer to see which one is waiting for further input from the server

	Connect()
	- Connects to the server. This is basically code I copied from a Socket tutorial. I don't have a great idea of how it works.

	processMessages()
	- Loops through messages that have been completely received, and interprets them. Messages will have two fields: type, and data.
	- Supporting Functions: 
		- readInt() - Reads an int from a string received by the server. (Basically just checks for an integer that ends with '!')
	
DRAW FUNCTIONS
	Draw()
	- Draws from sprites.png

	DrawPosition()
	- Draws a single pixel. Requires a specific pixel to be white on the sprite sheet.

	FillRect()
	- Draws a colored rectangle. Requires a specific pixel to be white on the sprite sheet.

	DrawSquare()
	- Draws an empty rectangle, depends on FillRect to work.

	mix()
	- Mixes two colors together.

AUDIO FUNCTIONS - Need to be reworked. It has some TG3 specific stuff like manaaging ambience.
	playSound()
	- Plays a sound effect, assuming it's been pre-loaded in the sfx array and exists in the Sounds folder. Warning: MP3's will have a tiny skip at the start, so looped mp3 audio will sound off 

TEXT FUNCTIONS 
	Print() - Prints text. Supports different alignments (LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER), fonts, and text wrapping. You can also add colored text by putting the color in asterisks ie *YELLOW*
	- Supporting Functions:
		- measureText() - measures the length of text, for wrapping purposes
		- getColor() - converts text colors into sf::Colors
		- charInfo() - returns information about where and how to draw letters on the sprite sheet
	
	low() - Converts text to lowercase
	
	trimNum() - Converts numbers into shorter text. Ie 1300 = 1.3k

MAIN FUNCTION
	main() - Runs when you start the program, as always in C++
	- First it initializes things, like the Window, and the Texture that gets drawn to the Window. It has a main loop that runs while the window is open. In here it handles events like mouse/keyboard input, Updates the FPS, and draws to the screen.
